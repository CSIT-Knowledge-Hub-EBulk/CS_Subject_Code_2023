These sources include popular algorithms for all computer science fields. Written in Python. Learn and apply. This repository offers live-code notebooks for algorithm 102. I implemented algorithm. 
It was tough and enjoyable. Do not expect the greatest, quickest, prettiest, or bug-free implementations. Expect hastily written code. A code with as much passion for algorithms as many has flaws.
 Use my code whatever you choose, but it is supplied "as-is". Your risk and responsibility for what occurs are yours.
